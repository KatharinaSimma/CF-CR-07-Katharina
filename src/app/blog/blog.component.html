      <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Word Aurora</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by Prof Katharina </p>

      <p>The word "aurora" is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun. Ancient Greek poets used the name metaphorically to refer to dawn, often mentioning its play of colours across the otherwise dark sky (e.g., "rosy-fingered dawn").<span class="float-right">  <a class="text-info" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora">-- Wikipedia</a></span> </p>

      <h2 class="blog-post-title">What are Auroral Particles?</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2013 by <a class="text-light" href="#">CaptainKathi</a></p>

      <p>The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.[42] Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.[43] These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field. Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.[44] Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.<span class="float-right">  <a class="text-info" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora">-- Wikipedia</a></span></p>

      <h2 class="blog-post-title">Does the aurora make a noise?</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-meta">December 14, 2013 by Froilein KÃ¤the</p>

      <p>Yes! Aurora noise, similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about 70 m (230 ft) above the Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.
